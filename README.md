# BMEG2813-simulation-toolkit
Simulation toolkit for University of Arkansas Biomechanics Course

You will need to do the following:
1.	You have to watch or read the walkthrough (Demos 1.3-1.5) the following demos (We have access to check that you have watched the full videos):
1.1.	What is Solidworks simulation
1.2.	Simulation access
1.3.	Statics - Lecture 3 problem 6 
1.4.	Homework 6 problem 2
1.5.	Homework 7 problem 5
2.	Download SolidWorks simulation files and access at least 7 from the 14 simulations in the box folder. You may use the written tutorials in the Demos box labeled with each problem as guidelines to completing each simulation.
3.	Take screenshots from the Solidworks simulations showing the simulation results.
4.	Add the screenshots to a word document and upload to Blackboard under the Simulation Toolkit Extra Credit assignment
5.	Complete 5-10 minutes Qualtrics survey (the survey link will be provided to you on Blackboard).  
Within each file containing an assembly or part, there is also a completed simulation that you may use as a reference if you are stuck.
