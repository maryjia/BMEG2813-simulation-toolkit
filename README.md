# BMEG2813-simulation-toolkit
Simulation toolkit for University of Arkansas Biomechanics Course

You will need to do the following:
1.	You have to watch or read the walkthrough (Demos 1.3-1.5) the following demos (We have access to check that you have watched the full videos):
1.1.	What is Solidworks simulation
1.2.	Simulation access
1.3.	Statics - Lecture 3 problem 6 
1.4.	Homework 6 problem 2
1.5.	Homework 7 problem 5
2.	Download SolidWorks simulation files and access at least 7 from the 14 simulations in the box folder. You may use the written tutorials in the Demos box labeled with each problem as guidelines to completing each simulation.
3.	Take screenshots from the Solidworks simulations showing the simulation results.
4.	Add the screenshots to a word document and upload to Blackboard under the Simulation Toolkit Extra Credit assignment
5.	Complete 5-10 minutes Qualtrics survey (the survey link will be provided to you on Blackboard).  
Within each file containing an assembly or part, there is also a completed simulation that you may use as a reference if you are stuck.
# Troubleshooting
If you are getting the error saying that the requested folder is unavailable, make sure that your file path does not begin with engrdocs.uark.edu\shares. Make sure that the top search bar has something along the lines of This PC > Local Disk (C: on ~). Do this by scrolling down in the browser on the left.

The reason why you need to do this is because SOLIDWORKS through Citrix is a virtually hosted program, and its by default going to try and read the files on the school's file network. I'll attach a picture to the box to show you what to look for.
